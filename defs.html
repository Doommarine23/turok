<h3 id=ammoInfo>ammoInfo</h3>

<p>Defines ammo types.</p>
<p>Specifies max ammo (with and without backpack) and HUD icon.</p>
<p>New ammo types can be created by simply adding their names to this file and listing their properties within their block.</p>
<p>Referenced by weapon definitions in <a href=#weaponInfo>weaponInfo</a> (which ammo types the weapon will draw from) and weapon/ammo pickup actor defs.</p>


<h3 id=damageInfo>damageInfo</h3>

<p>Defines damage type properties.</p>
<p>Referred to by <a href=fx.html#Events>fx events</a> (and probably elsewhere, e.g., for melee).</p>
<p>Most damage types are fairly generic, and may be referenced by several projectile types, so be careful when changing values here.  It's often preferable to change which damage type a projectile refers to, rather than changing the properties of the damage type here.</p>
<p>New damage types can be defined by simply adding its name to this file, and listing its properties within its block.</p>
<p>New damage properties can also be created by simply adding them to a damage type's definition.  They won't do anything by default, but you'll be able to test for them in an actor's script to program new reactions.</p>

<p>Levels are defined by a name and a level number, followed by a block containing level properties.</p>

<h3 id=textureSetInfo>textureSetInfo</h3>

<p>Defines texture variants and animations.</p>
<p>Texture sets are defined by a parent texture, followed by a block containing animation properties and a list of texture variants.</p>
<p>Any surface in the game using a parent texture listed in this file will have access to the variants in its set, and animate if set.</p>
<p>Any texture without any variants or animation can be added to this list, and any surface in the game that uses it will then be affected by it automatically.</p>

		</td>

</table>


<h3 id=weaponInfo>weaponInfo</h3>

<p>Defines player weapons.</p>
<p>These are the things that actually get used by the player.  Weapon pickup actor defs refer to these to tell the game which weapon to give the player when picked up.</p>
<p>New weapons can be defined by adding their name followed by their slot number, and listing their properties within their block.</p>
<p>Slot number determines order within the weapon selection wheel, and key bind.</p>
<p>Make sure your weapons' slot numbers are reflected in the <code>turokWeapons</code> enum in <a href="scripts.html#common_weapons">scripts/common.txt</a>.</p>
